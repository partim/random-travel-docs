# Where to Buy Interrail Reservations

In some countries, reservations are mandatory when using an Interrail
or Eurail ticket for travelling with certain services. This page tries
to collect information on how to purchase such reservations and at what
cost.

This page is currently woefully incomplete. More countries will be added
as I explore them or someone provides information – ideally as a Github
issue here.

# Italy

Reservations are mandatory for all Trenitalia long distance trains:
Intercity, Eurocity, and the variously coloured Frecce. Reservations are
_not_ required for regional services even if they are marked otherwise in
timetables.

Reservations cost 3 euros for Intercitys and 10 euros for Frecce.

Reservations can be purchased online from

* [ÖBB online](https://shop.oebbtickets.at) without a surcharge. Change
  the discount for traveller to ‘Interrail / Eurail - Globalpass’ and
  select ‘one-way tickets and day tickets.’ You do not need an account.
* [Interrail online](https://www.interrail.eu/en/book-reservations#/) at
  a surcharge of 2 euros per reservation. You need an account and have to
  register your pass.

Reservations can be purchased from booking offices at Italian stations.
They are _not_ available from ticket machines.

# Poland

Reservations are mandatory for all PKP Intercity trains (that’s the
company, not the train type), i.e., all long distance trains.

Reservations can be purchased online from

* [PKP Intercity](https://www.intercity.pl/en/) at a cost of 1 PLN per
  person and train (about 0.20 euros). You need an account.
  Interrail/Eurail discount is only available for direct connections.
  Thus, you need to book every train separately. Cross border services are
  not available.
* [Czech railways ČD](https://www.cd.cz/) at a cost of 73 CZK per
  person and train (about 3 euros). You need an account. Cross-border
  services into Czechia are also available. Cross-border services into
  Germany are not.
* [Interrail online](https://www.interrail.eu/en/book-reservations#/) but
  only as paper tickets with a lead time of 6 days.

Reservations can be purchased from Polish booking offices at no cost (XXX
Is that correct?). 
They are _not_ available from ticket machines.
