# Where to Buy Interrail Reservations

In some countries, reservations are mandatory when using an Interrail
or Eurail ticket for travelling with certain services. This page tries
to collect information on how to purchase such reservations and at what
cost.

This page is currently woefully incomplete. More countries will be added
as I explore them or someone provides information – ideally as a [Github
issue](https://github.com/partim/random-travel-docs/issues/new)
here, alternatively via email at [hn@nvnc.de](mailto:hn@nvnc.de)
or Mastodon at [@partim@social.tchncs.de](https://social.tchncs.de/@partim).

Please also consult the
[Interrail/Eurail reservation
guide](https://www.seat61.com/interrail-and-eurail-reservations.htm) by
the The Man in Seat 61.

## Contents

The page is split into three sections:

* Domestic day trains per country:

  [France](#france) • [Italy](#italy) • [Poland](#poland) •
  [UK](#united-kingdom) 

* Cross-border day trains:

  [ICE Germany/Netherlands](#ice-germany-netherlands)

* Overnight sleeper services. (TODO)

* [International booking offices](#international-booking-offices) – what a
  booking office in your own country may be able to do for you.


## Domestic Day Trains

### France

Reservations are mandatory for all TGV and Intercities services and for
select TER services. For TGVs and Intercities, Interrail/Eurail
reservations are sold in two categories. A limited number of reservations
is available for 10 EUR after which 20 EUR are charged. But even the
expensive category is limited – regular tickets may still be available
when a train is sold out for Interrail.

Reservations can be purchased online from

* [Belgian Railways
  SNCB](https://travel.b-europe.com/eurail-ge/en/booking-tgv#TravelWish)
  for TGV trains only (!) with a booking fee of 4 euros. You don’t need an
  account but you do need your pass cover number. For mobile passes, you
  can [generate a cover number
  online](https://www.eurail.com/en/book-reservations#/generatePassCoverNumber).
* [Interrail](https://www.interrail.eu/en/book-reservations#/) at
  a surcharge of 2 euros per reservation. You need an account and have to
  register your pass.

  Unclear: Can you buy reservations for TERs from Interrail?
* [Trainplanet](https://trainplanet.com/) sells reservations for TGVs and
  Intercities at what looks like a 10% surcharge. Don’t forget to switch
  the currency to euros! You need a pass cover number. They do not, however,
  seem to be able to sell reservations for TER services.

Reservations can also be bought from Grand Lignes ticket machines and
SNCF booking offices.

Note that it seems that the online services occasionally have differing
prices and availability for the same train. So it may also be that those
differ with machines and booking offices (domestic and abroad) again.

### Italy

Reservations are mandatory for all Trenitalia long distance trains:
Intercity, Eurocity, and the variously coloured Frecce. Reservations are
_not_ required for regional services even if they are marked otherwise in
timetables.

Reservations cost 3 euros for Intercitys and 10 euros for Frecce.

Reservations can be purchased online from

* [ÖBB](https://shop.oebbtickets.at) without a surcharge. Change
  the discount for traveller to ‘Interrail / Eurail - Globalpass’ and
  select ‘one-way tickets and day tickets.’ You do not need an account.
* [Interrail](https://www.interrail.eu/en/book-reservations#/) at
  a surcharge of 2 euros per reservation. You need an account and have to
  register your pass.
* [Trainplanet](https://trainplanet.com/) sells reservations for TGVs and
  Intercities at what looks like a 10% surcharge. Don’t forget to switch
  the currency to euros! You need a pass cover number.

Reservations can be purchased from booking offices at Italian stations.
They are _not_ available from ticket machines.

### Norway

Reservations are mandatory on all long distance services with the
exception of the Oslo to Gothenburg service.

Reservations can not be purchased online or on ticket machines. You have
to either call Entur, the organization that sells railway tickets in
Norway, at [+47 61 27 90 88](tel:+4761279088) or go to one of their 
ticket offices, available in Bergen, Stavanger, Trondheim, Oslo, and Olso
airport.

### Poland

Reservations are mandatory for all PKP Intercity trains (that’s the
company, not the train type), i.e., all long distance trains.

Reservations can be purchased online from

* [PKP Intercity](https://www.intercity.pl/en/) at a cost of 1 PLN per
  person and train (about 0.20 euros). You need an account.
  Interrail/Eurail discount is only available for direct connections.
  Thus, you need to book every train separately. Cross border services are
  not available.
* [Czech railways ČD](https://www.cd.cz/) at a cost of 73 CZK per
  person and train (about 3 euros) for IC and TLK trains. They cannot sell
  reservations for EIP trains. You need an account. Cross-border
  services into Czechia are also available. Cross-border services into
  Germany are not.
* [Trainplanet](https://trainplanet.com/) sells reservations for all trains,
  including cross border services into Czechia and Germany. IC and TLK
  services cost 5 euros, EIP services 11 euros. Don’t forget to switch
  the currency to euros! You need a pass cover number.
* [Interrail](https://www.interrail.eu/en/book-reservations#/) but
  only as paper tickets with a lead time of 6 days.

Reservations can be purchased from Polish booking offices at no cost (XXX
Is that correct?). 
They are _not_ available from ticket machines.

### United Kingdom

Reservations are not mandatory for day trains despite information provided
otherwise. This has been confirmed by booking office and on-board staff.

If you still want one, reservations can be purchased online from

* [GWR](https://www.gwr.com/) free of charge for all train operators. You
  need to register an account and can then make reservations from the ‘My
  Bookings’ section.
* [LNER](https://www.lner.co.uk/travel-information/make-a-reservation/)
  for LNER trains only.

You can also get seat reservations for free from any booking office.


## Cross-border Day Trains

### ICE Germany/Netherlands

ICE services on the route Amsterdam—Cologne—Frankfurt (—Basel) will be
mandatory to reserve between June 17 and August 18, 2023.
